# DSA-Assignment
Data Structure Assignments Repository
Welcome to my repository for Data Structures Assignments. This repository contains various coding exercises, projects, and notes that demonstrate my understanding and application of fundamental data structures using practical examples and problem-solving techniques.

📚# **Course Overview**
This repository complements my coursework in Data Structures as part of my studies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The assignments cover core concepts including:

**Arrays and Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)**
Stacks and Queues (including Deques and Priority Queues)
Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps, etc.)
Graphs (Adjacency Lists/Matrices, DFS, BFS, etc.)
Hash Tables and Hash Maps
Searching and Sorting Algorithms
Recursion and Dynamic Programming
File Storage and Data Persistence
Real-world applications and mini-projects
💻 Technologies Used
Language: Python (main), C (for some assignments)
IDE: VS Code / PyCharm
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Graph Visualization (e.g., Graphviz for trees/graphs)


🚀# **Notable Projects**
SACCO Management System: A data structure-based savings and credit system for rural farmers. Implements core banking operations using efficient data structures like linked lists, hash maps, queues, and stacks. Features include file storage and transaction-based balance calculations.
📈**Goals**
Master efficient implementation of data structures
Understand performance trade-offs (time and space complexity)
Build scalable, real-world applications based on solid data structure foundations
